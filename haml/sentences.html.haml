      This page takes a list of Chinese sentences, looks up words you don't know in [a dictionary](http://dict.revised.moe.edu.tw/index.html) and produces beautiful Anki cards of the type you can see on [this screenshot](/assets/images/sentences.png). The sentences can be simp/trad but the explanations on the cards will always be in traditional characters. To try it out, follow the instructions below.
