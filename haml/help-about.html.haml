        This page takes a list of simplified or traditional Chinese words and turns them into Anki cards with the word on the front and pinyin and English definitions on the back. You can see an example of the type of cards this page produces [here](/assets/images/vocab-expl.png).

      To import the generated cards to Anki, please follow these steps:
      %ol
        %li
          If this is the first time you use this service, please download a vocab deck to import to: 
          %a{:href => "/assets/anki-decks/Vocab-simp.apkg"} Simplified
          :escaped
            /
          = succeed '.' do
            %a{:href => "/assets/anki-decks/Vocab-trad.apkg"} Traditional

          :escaped
            You can also use an existing deck if you know how to map the columns in the csv to the fields of your deck. The format of the csv is <simp>\t<trad>\t<pinyin&english>.
        %li Copy the contents of the first text area below to a text file and save the file (you will delete this file later).
        %li Open your sentences deck in Anki and select Fileâ†’Import.
        %li Make sure "Allow HTML in fields" is checked and click on "Import".
        %li The cards should now appear in your deck and you can delete the text file you created in step 2.
